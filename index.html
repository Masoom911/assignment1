<p> Dear Elieen <p>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of 
Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your phD next year. I will 
answer your questions one by one, in the following sections. <p>
<h1> Starting dates </h1>
<p> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study recent application to join 
us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study with us at any time, however 
it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates 
for each one are as follows: <p>
<li> First semester:9 September 2016 </li>
<li> Second semester: 15 January 2017 </li>
<li> Third semester: 2 May 2017 </li>
<p> Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. </p>
<p>You can find more information about  <a href= 'https://www.example.com'>important university dates </a> our website. </p>
<h1> Subjects of study </h1>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facilty - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in 
the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like 
to have on out team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority: </p>
</li>
<p>1 </p></li>
<p>2 </p></li>
<p>3 </p></li>
</li>
<p> So please can you provide more informatio on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, 
required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
<h1> Exotic dance moves </h1>
<p> Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i> did </i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer you question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
<p> Polynesian chicken dance </p>
<p> Icelandic brownian shuffle </p>
<p> Arctic robot dance </p>
<p>For more of my research, see my <a href= 'https://www.example.com'> exotic dance research page </a> . </p>
<p> Yours sincerely,</p>
<p> Dr Eleanor Gaye </p>
